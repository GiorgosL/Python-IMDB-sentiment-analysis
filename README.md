# Python-IMDB-sentiment-analysis

The dataset consists of reviews and their respective status being classified as either positive or negative. For this project the performance of Linear Regression and Multinomial Naive Bayes will be compared under the following document representations:

- Bag of words

- Tfidf

- Ngram (1,2)


Furthermore, a neural network approach has been followed in order to classify the sentiments in the dataset, including the following:

- A simple feedforward neural network trained using the tfidf sklearn tokenizer.

- A recurrent neural netowrk (LSTM) trained using the keras tokenizer.
